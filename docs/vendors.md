# Vendors

Tenant admins are able to invite vendors as Tenant co-admins, or as application users to your services. Localised identities can be created for them through the TechPass portal.

?> A vendor is a non-Government developer that is collaborating on a Government project or using a Tenant service

?> The invited vendor would receive an email indicating the **username** and a phone SMS for the **password**
