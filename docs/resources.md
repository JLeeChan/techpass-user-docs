### Authorization & Access Control Model
To help us design a proper access control model, tenants need to answer two questions:

- **Who** has access to our application/service?
- **What** actions can they perform on our application/service?

In TechPass, Tenants can configure their applications to only allow authorised users to sign in. Think of it as allowing a user to enter the front door of your house. This is done by ensuring the [*User Assignment Required*](applications/#user-assignment-required) setting is checked. Alternatively, you can uncheck the setting to allow ANY user with a TechPass account to sign in to your app.

A user can be assigned access to your app either manually through the TechPass portal or programmatically via the [*Automation API*](). Tenants can implement their own customized onboarding workflows for their services by using the APIs. They can also manage access remotely through their own administrative console instead of using TechPass's web console.
