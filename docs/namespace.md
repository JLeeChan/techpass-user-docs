# Tenant Namespace
?> This section is meant for TechPass Tenants.

Each project that has onboarded with TechPass is given a TechPass Tenant Namespace. The namespace isolates your project's resources from other projects in TechPass. Other tenants will not have any access to your tenant resources, such as clients, credentials and API Keys.
