# Tenant Namespace
Each service that has onboarded to TechPass are called tenants. Tenants get access to features that allow them to configure and consume TechPass services. Each tenant is given a namespace on TechPass. A Namespaces is an isolated environment within TechPass that safeguards your resources from other tenants. 

Only authorized Tenant Administrators get access to a specific project's namespace and other tenant administrators cannot gain access to your namespace unless authorized by you or your co-admins.

As Tenant Admin, you will see a list of Tenant Namespaces that you have been authorized to access on your dashboard.

You will see the Display Name, Description of the namespace and a directory ID. We will touch on directory ID in later sections. You will also see a list of current Tenant Administrators authorised to manage this namespace. 

You can update a namespace's *Display Name* and *Description* here. These information will be useful to help other TechPass users know what your product is about.

You can also authorize up to 5 *Tenant Administrators* per namespace (including yourself).
